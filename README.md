# google-discovery-to-swagger

Script for converting [Google Discovery format](https://developers.google.com/discovery/v1/reference/apis) into [OpenAPI 3.0](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification)

## Usage

If you need to convert some APIs from Google Discovery service I have good news for you, it is already [done](https://github.com/APIs-guru/openapi-directory/tree/master/APIs/googleapis.com) :smile:

This library was developed of another project: [APIs.guru](https://github.com/APIs-guru/openapi-directory) - Wikipedia for Web APIs.
  
**IMPORTANT**: don't use Github RAW links because they are subject to change.
Instead you can find direct links for any particular API in [this list](https://api.apis.guru/v2/list.json).
All OpenAPI documents are updated, validated and fixed on a weekly basis.

If you have non-Google API document in this format please consider adding it to the collection: just open an [issue](https://github.com/APIs-guru/openapi-directory/issues/new) with link to it.

If it is an **internal** API you can use [api-spec-converter](https://github.com/lucybot/api-spec-converter) tool to do conversion for you.
